The first group of shapes draws an edge

A circle is a shape with (x,y) center and radius
An ellipse is a shape with (x,y) center and radius1, radius2
A line is a shape with (x,y) and (x2,y2)
A Rectangle is a shape but it is already written
A polyline has an array of points (x,y) and connects them all
A triangle is a shape with (x,y) corner and (x2,y2), (x3,y3)
Star (n points) with center (x,y), radius r
Polygon (n points) with center (x,y), radius r

The second group of shapes fills the shape
A Filledcircle is a shape with (x,y) center and radius
A FilledEllipse is a shape with (x,y) center and radius1, radius2
A FilledRectangle is a shape but it is already written
A FilledTriangle is a shape with (x,y) corner and (x2,y2), (x3,y3)
Filled Star (n points) with center (x,y), radius r
FilledPolygon (n points) with center (x,y), radius r
